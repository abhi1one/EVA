Have tried to write few line regarding research.
Title: Gradcam as bonding box
Problem statement: Presenting Gradcam as a plausible alternative to bonding box solution by training a CNN in 3 parts and get a bonding Bax around the defined class of object. 
Part 1: Train for 50 epochs and review grad cam visualization
Part 2: Continue with weights from part 1 and train more to get better visualization of Gradcam as bonding box
Part 3: Train and tune Part 2 training to get a more precise bonding box from head cam

Things we will need to discuss and finalize:
1. Data set we want to use-Coco dataset(Suggested by Rohan)
2. Model we want to use
3. Define a efficient grad cam function
4. How do we define weights/loss to so the model can observe full object in the image

Questions to address:
1. How to copy gradcam for 1 network to another?
2. How to use gradcam for next training?
3. What needs to be done in order to consider varying size of gradcam?
4. How to replicate Ancor box with respect to gradcam?
5. How to draw bonding box once we have gradcam?
6. Are there pretrained weights for Coco data set?
7. Is annoitation necessary for training object detection?

To get started: 6, 1, 2

So first steps for us would be to:
Review Coco data set and figure out classes.
Find out a model and availability of reusable weigths for Coco dataset.

Why to use gradcam instead of bonding box?
